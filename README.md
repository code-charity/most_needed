### Open Source is lacking prioritization / coordination at scale

In a day a few people per million, may make contributions on Github or in Wikipedia, with immediate or substantial usage. - Why not few times more?

Wikipedia is "the largest repository" (which enables a [global todo list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most-linked-to_redlinks))
Why aren't there more large, linked, interdisciplinary projects?*  
One Purpose could be to collect, analyze, combine and thus refine the 'fragmented cornucopia' of knowledge about nutrients.

Comparably according to worldgivingreport.org ~ 1% of personal income is donated to charity or given personally.
A majority might stay local and thus can't be prioritized by global poverty, efficiency or urgency.
And people in poorer places give more in percent. 

### Skill-/Talent- & Purpose-Matching 

How to answer online volunteers asking: **"What is the best (=highest-impact?) task I could work on today, given my talents and skills?"**

Another example for _potentially_ high impact:  Unicode.org uniformly defined 1,000s of emojis & pictograms, which are global language now. (With little grammar (color, gender), which could advance.) - There also are sets of 10,000s - specifically to aid disablities or illiteracy. And the largest one is commercially restricted.  Why aren't they unified? - Should this lead to my / your / our next project? <a href="https://github.com/mulberrysymbols/mulberry-symbols/issues/71"> mulberry-symbols#71 </a>


### Second thoughts

"Societal progress should be as fast as technical progress or ahead" How? 

Can we further world work and maximize good purpose, but serve good purpose only?  How to rule out adverse effects? 
How to rule out supporting centralization, hype, hubris or decadence?  

If successfull, how to personally ensure our drive is and stays helping people? Can we stay humble if we successfully maximize efficency of good impact? 

How to assess Wikipedia's total impacts? - It reduced the separation of languages and sowed foundational AI knowledge.
